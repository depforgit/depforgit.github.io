        <h2>Classification</h2>
        <p>
            For the understanding of colours, we need to classify them into groups, so we can talk about specific groups.
            It is reccomended that we classify the colours on the basis of their visibility i.e. their power to throw back electrons.
            The colours which can throw back more protons are understandable and calming.
            Other colours raise suspiction, attention, contrast etc...
            So, let them be classified in 3 categories :
            <ol>
                <li>Bright</li>
                <li>Medium</li>
                <li>Dark</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
